1.

Write a function chooseCheckoutLane(). This function should take in a single number argument representing the number of items a customer has. If the customer has 12 items or fewer, the function should return "express lane". Otherwise, the function should return "regular lane".
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

In the U.S., citizens can vote if they are 18 years old or older. Write a function canIVote() that takes in a number representing an age, and return the string "yes" if they can vote, and the string "no" if they cannot.
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.

We tested your functions to make sure they work with various inputs, but you should be testing your own functions. Test each of your functions twiceâ€”once with an input that will enter the if block and once with an input that will enter the else block. Make sure to print the results to the terminal.
