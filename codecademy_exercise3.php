Heya! Can you help me out. Use echo to print the answer to the terminal.

I’m trying to figure out how much money I should have. At the start of the day I had $94.

    I spent $4.25 on coffee
    A friend gave me $7 that he owed me
    I went out for a meal. The bill was $23.50, but I also gave a 20% tip.
    Some friends and I found $20 on the ground and split it four ways

I think that’s everything.

Use a single chained operation to get your result!

echo 94 - 4.25 + 7 - (23.50 * 1.20) + (20 / 4);
